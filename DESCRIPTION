Description: This statistical method uses the nearest neighbor algorithm to estimate absolute distances between single cells 
	based on a chosen constellation of surface proteins, with these distances being a measure of the similarity between the 
	two cells being compared. Based on Sen, N., Mukherjee, G., and Arvin, A.M. (2015) <DOI:10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.07.008>.
